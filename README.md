# Why Combine Time Signatures?

Making progressive genres (progressive rock or metal, math rock, post-hardcore, etc.) often leads to combining different time signatures to create a novel feeling through rhythm, combinations of 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, etc. all adding up to a set total amount of beats. Bands like *TTNG* (Formerly known as *This Town Needs Guns*), *Jinjer* and *Periphery* inspired me to make this, and make music using this technique.

# Use: 
In this script, the variable ***target*** is the total amount of beats you're going for, and the list ***constituents*** contains the numerator of all time signatures you're providing to be combined into the target amount.
